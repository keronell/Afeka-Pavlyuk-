          <h2>Short subtitle about this place</h2>
          <p>
            My first lacture at Afeka was held in the Ficus building. I remember
            being amazed by the modern design and the welcoming atmosphere. The
            building houses several important departments and offers stunning
            views of the campus.

            Besides its academic significance, the Ficus building is also known
            for its beautiful landscaping. The surrounding gardens and seating
            areas provide a perfect place for relaxation and socializing between
            classes.
