    <h1>Place 5 – "HaSapot" at the Ficus backside</h1>

      "HaSapot" is one of the most iconic structures at Afeka collage.
      Its unique architecture and vibrant surroundings make it a favorite spot

          <p>
            My first lecture at Afeka was held in "HaSapot". I remember
            being amazed by the modern design and the welcoming atmosphere. The
            building houses several important departments and offers stunning
            views of the campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides its academic significance, "HaSapot" is also known
            for its beautiful landscaping. The surrounding gardens and seating
            areas provide a perfect place for relaxation and socializing between
            classes.
