          <p>
            My first lecture at Afeka was held in the CLab Building (Near Ficus). I remember
            being amazed by the modern design and the welcoming atmosphere. The
            building houses several important departments and offers stunning
            views of the campus.

            Besides its academic significance, the CLab Building (Near Ficus) is also known
            for its beautiful landscaping. The surrounding gardens and seating
            areas provide a perfect place for relaxation and socializing between
            classes.
