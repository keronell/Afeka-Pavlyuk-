          <p>
            My first lecture at Afeka was held in the Cafeteria of the Kiriya. I remember
            being amazed by the modern design and the welcoming atmosphere. The
            building houses several important departments and offers stunning
            views of the campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides its academic significance, the Cafeteria of the Kiriya is also known
            for its beautiful landscaping. The surrounding gardens and seating
            areas provide a perfect place for relaxation and socializing between
            classes.
